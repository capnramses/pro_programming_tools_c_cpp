/* Example of using a .clang-format file

A .clang-format file created from webkit style sits in this folder.
Since it starts with a '.' this will not be visible by default on Unix systems but you can still open it.
You can tweak or replace this file.
If you apply `clang-format` to these files it will format them using the .clang-format file
